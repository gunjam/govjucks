This is a jekyll 2 site that generates the docs for
[govjucks](https://github.com/gunjam/govjucks). If you find a bug
in the docs, please file an issue, or even better, fork it and fix it!

Run `make` to publish and look it at locally.

Run `make prod` to publish the production version, and then push the
generated `_site` folder on the `gh-pages` branch of the
[govjucks](https://github.com/gunjam/govjucks) repo.
